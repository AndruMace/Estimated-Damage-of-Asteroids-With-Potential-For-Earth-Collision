# Estimated-Damage-of-Orbiting-Celestial-Objects-With-Potential-For-Earth-Collision
This program outputs a bar plot of the top ten most potentially damaging asteroids that are on a potential collision course with Earth.

Tools: Python with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas data libraries. 
 
Note: While in my IPython notebook, I refer to the orbiting bodies as 'asteroids', this isn't semantically correct, as some of the objects don't necessarily fall under the definition of 'asteroid'.
